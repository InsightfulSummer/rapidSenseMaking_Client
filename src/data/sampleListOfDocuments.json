        "abstract" : "In recent years, data science emerged as a new and important discipline. It can be viewed as an amalgamation of classical disciplines like statistics, data mining, databases, and distributed systems. Existing approaches need to be combined to turn abundantly available data into value for individuals, organizations, and society. Moreover, new challenges have emerged, not just in terms of size (“Big Data”) but also in terms of the questions to be answered. This book focuses on the analysis of behavior based on event data. Process mining techniques use event data to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, compare process variants, and suggest improvements. In later chapters, we will show that process mining provides powerful tools for today’s data scientist. However, before introducing the main topic of the book, we provide an overview of the data science discipline.",

        "abstract" : "Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot—even “sexy”—career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.",

        "abstract" : "According to revisions of survey law taking effect on January 1, 2003, the Korean geodetic datum has been changed from a local geodetic to a world geodetic system. Since the datum change demands a geographical data transformation, the National Geographic Information Institute has established step-by-step plans for the transformation of the land data constructed through the National GIS Project, and it is in progress. For maritime data, however, no detailed transformation plan has been established yet. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the maritime geographic data obtained through the Maritime GIS project and set up the data transformation scheme to a world geodetic system. In this study, the datum transformation parameters especially for the maritime geographical data are determined. From database constructed through MGIS, a total of 492 coordinate pairs were used in parameter determination initially. At this stage, three popular seven parameter transformation models, Bursa-Wolf, Molodensky and Veis model, and the multi regression equation are applied, and the transformation parameters from the Molodensky model are selected for its accuracy and consistency with the land data transformation method. To eliminate the local bias caused by the nonequally distributed stations, a network optimization is applied and 42 stations are selected to determine the final transformation parameters. The distortion after applying the similarity transformation is modeled through a least squares collocation with Gaussian model, and high accuracy better than 15 cm in coordinate transformation is obtained.",

For the real data processing case, wave equation numerical model experiments were conducted which resulted in a new method for calculating objective functions based on the waveform and modifications to the calculation equation for minimum static correction errors to make the method suitable for real data static correction processing using inhomogeneous velocity models with lower velocity boundary relief. Real data processing results demonstrate the method’s superiority.",

        "abstract" : "A semi-dynamic geodetic datum, composed of a static geodetic datum and a surface deformation model, is proposed in this study to maintain the accuracy of geodetic datum in Taiwan. A concept to construct the surface deformation model is also suggested to accommodate the characteristics of temporal variation of the velocity field and coseismic displacements caused by earthquakes in Taiwan. In this study, we proposed a surface deformation model, containing a secular velocity grid model during 2000–2016 and a coseismic displacement grid model of the 2016 ML 6.6 Meinong earthquake, as an example to examine its adaptability in Taiwan. The secular velocity field relative to the station KMNM from 2000 to 2016 was first evaluated in this study using data from 380 continuous GNSS stations in Taiwan. Integrating 672 campaign-mode GNSS velocities from 2002 to 2016, a secular velocity grid model was constructed using the Kriging interpolation method. The high-precision coseismic displacements of the 2016 Meinong earthquake calculated using the IGS ultra-rapid orbit were also evidenced. The coseismic displacement grid model for all Taiwan for this event was built using the kinematic dislocation model to prevent contamination from nontectonic sources. Another 1341 independent GNSS control points surveyed in 2013 and 2016 were adopted to validate the reliability of the surface deformation model. After correction by the deformation model, 1219 points (91%) matched the criterion at the urban region of cadastral surveying in Taiwan (< 6 cm). The Electronic Global Navigation Satellite System (e-GNSS) in Taiwan is suggested to be integrated with the geodetic semi-dynamic datum to improve the precision of e-GNSS and to monitor the accuracy of the surface deformation model in the Taiwan semi-dynamic datum.",

        "abstract" : "This paper describes a robust diagnosis method for a rotor system with a journal bearing. To enhance the robustness of a journal bearing diagnosis system, it is of great importance to define an optimum datum unit for featuring anomaly states of the rotor system. To support the research goal, this study makes use of three measures for class separation, including Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR), and a newly proposed measure: probability of separation (PoS). From the viewpoint of class separability, this work found that PoS is more attractive than other methods for quantification of class separation. PoS offers favorable properties like normalization, boundedness, and high sensitivity. A generic algorithm integrated with one of three measures consistently suggested the optimum datum units among the feasible datum units. Optimum datum units were found to be one-cycle for time-domain features and sixty-cycles for frequency-domain features. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the optimum datum units was used for diagnosing a normal and three anomaly states. The health classification results showed that the proposed optimum datum units can outperform other datum units.",

        "abstract" : "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in many critical applications, including Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) applications, automated financial trading applications, autonomous vehicles, and intrusion detection systems for the decision-making process of users or automated systems. However, malicious adversaries have strong interests in manipulation the operations of machine learning algorithms to achieve their objectives in gaining financially, injecting injury or disasters. Adversaries against ML can be classified based on their capabilities and goals into two types: Adversary who has full knowledge of the ML models and parameters (white-box scenario) and one that does not have any knowledge and use guessing techniques to figure out the ML model and its parameters (black-box scenario). In both scenarios, the adversaries will attempt to maliciously manipulate model either during training or testing. Defending against these attacks can be successful by following three methods: 1) making the ML model robust to adversary, 2) validating and verifying input, or 3) changing ML architecture. In this paper, we present a resilient machine learning (rML) ensemble against adversarial attacks by dynamically changing the ML architecture and the ML models to be used such that the adversaries have no knowledge about the current ML model being used and consequently stop their attempt to manipulate the ML operations at testing phase. We evaluate the effectiveness of our rML ensemble using the benchmarking, zero-query dataset “DAmageNet” that contains both clean and adversarial image samples. We use three main neural networks in our ensemble that includes VGG16, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. The experimental results show that our rML can tolerate the adversarial samples and achieve high classification accuracy with small execution time degradation.",

        "abstract" : "In this short editorial we present some thoughts on present and future trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) generally, and Machine Learning (ML) specifically. Due to the huge ongoing success in machine learning, particularly in statistical learning from big data, there is rising interest of academia, industry and the public in this field. Industry is investing heavily in AI, and spin-offs and start-ups are emerging on an unprecedented rate. The European Union is allocating a lot of additional funding into AI research grants, and various institutions are calling for a joint European AI research institute. Even universities are taking AI/ML into their curricula and strategic plans. Finally, even the people on the street talk about it, and if grandma knows what her grandson is doing in his new start-up, then the time is ripe: We are reaching a new AI spring. However, as fantastic current approaches seem to be, there are still huge problems to be solved: the best performing models lack transparency, hence are considered to be black boxes. The general and worldwide trends in privacy, data protection, safety and security make such black box solutions difficult to use in practice. Specifically in Europe, where the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May, 28, 2018 which affects everybody (right of explanation). Consequently, a previous niche field for many years, explainable AI, explodes in importance. For the future, we envision a fruitful marriage between classic logical approaches (ontologies) with statistical approaches which may lead to context-adaptive systems (stochastic ontologies) that might work similar as the human brain.",

This can lead to misconceptions of its real impact and range of application, a problem especially concerning young people. This contribution focuses on the theory-driven development and practical experience with an unplugged workshop concept, which is about a simple technique of machine learning, as a basis for possible teaching units for high school students. For this purpose, the focus of the workshop is an action-oriented method to simulate the classification of screws with two different lengths. Workshop participants can reconstruct linear classification by moving a classifier represented by a wooden strip according to defined rules after each insertion of training data on a pinboard. The aim is to examine whether and how the topic can be made understandable at school. Pre- and posttests are used to evaluate the impact of the workshop on the participants’ image of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The results of this research suggest that it is possible to reduce simple methods of machine learning for teaching this topic at school. Moreover, it seems that even a 90-min workshop can change the participants’ conceptions of machine learning and artificial intelligence to a more realistic appreciation of their impact.",

        "abstract" : "Considerable effort has been put toward the development of intelligent and natural interfaces between users and computer systems. In line with this endeavor, several modes of information (e.g., visual, audio, and pen) that are used either individually or in combination have been proposed. The use of gestures to convey information is an important part of human communication. Hand gesture recognition is widely used in many applications, such as in computer games, machinery control (e.g., crane), and thorough mouse replacement. Computer recognition of hand gestures may provide a natural computer interface that allows people to point at or to rotate a computer-aided design model by rotating their hands. Hand gestures can be classified into two categories: static and dynamic. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research on gesture taxonomy, its representations, and recognition techniques. This paper summarizes the surveys carried out in human--computer interaction (HCI) studies and focuses on different application domains that use hand gestures for efficient interaction. This exploratory survey aims to provide a progress report on static and dynamic hand gesture recognition (i.e., gesture taxonomies, representations, and recognition techniques) in HCI and to identify future directions on this topic.",

Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human–computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.",

The principles of organization and the main characteristics and types of multimodal user interfaces, which employ concurrently several tools for automatic processing (recognition and synthesis) of userinputted heterogeneous information, are detailed. The combination of computers with speech and multimodal interfaces, designed for user-friendly information input/output, creates universal information–communicative technologies, man coming to the fore in the interaction between man and computer.

        "abstract" : "Homo sapiens is not just a tool-using species, they also can invent and develop tools. This is the feature that distinguishes humans from other species. It is necessary to get rid of the perceptual dominance of the present state of the material to invent and develop a tool. It is based on a mental process: designing. So how was that possible? In this article, I propose an evolutionary hypothesis in response to this question: the referential triangle. Accordingly, the relationship that people establish with things is mentally indirect, but the relationship they establish with each other is mentally direct. The hypothesis claims that the mental solutions of people have naturally established with each other are also used to invent and develop tools. The latest and most interesting product of this mechanism is artificial intelligence. Because artificial intelligence also acts as an inorganic system. What distinguishes it from other machines in this context is its social behavior. Artificial intelligence can generate social signals. So can artificial intelligence be both a tool and a partner at the same time in the referential triangle established with the tools by the human? In other words, can children, for instance, socially interact with artificial intelligence, just as they do naturally with people around? The article draws attention to that this problem should be included in the cultural psychological research agenda.",

Methodological implications for knowledge engineering and for human-computer interaction are studied. It turns out that in order to achieve the goal of developing human-oriented (in contrast to technology-oriented) human-computer interfaces developers have to develop sound knowledge of the structure and the representational dynamics of the cognitive system which is interacting with the computer. \n\n We show that in a first step it is necessary to study and investigate the different levels and forms of representation that are involved in the interaction processes between computers and human cognitive systems. Only if designers have achieved some understanding about these representational mechanisms, user interfaces enabling individual experiences and skill development can be designed. In this paper we review mechanisms and processes for knowledge representation on a conceptual, epistemological, and methodologieal level, and sketch some ways out of the identified dilemmas for cognitive modeling in the domain of human-computer interaction.",

        "abstract" : "This paper analyzes epistemological and ontological dimensions of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) through an analysis of the functions of computer systems in relation to their users. It is argued that the primary relation between humans and computer systems has historically been epistemic: computers are used as information-processing and problem-solving tools that extend human cognition, thereby creating hybrid cognitive systems consisting of a human processor and an artificial processor that process information in tandem. In this role, computer systems extend human cognition. Next, it is argued that in recent years, the epistemic relation between humans and computers has been supplemented by an ontic relation. Current computer systems are able to simulate virtual and social environments that extend the interactive possibilities found in the physical environment. This type of relationship is primarily ontic, and extends to objects and places that have a virtual ontology. Increasingly, computers are not just information devices, but portals to worlds that we inhabit. The aforementioned epistemic and ontic relationships are unique to information technology and distinguish human-computer relationships from other human-technology relationships.",

Rather than directly observe movement and behavior in small numbers of animals, over short time-spans and in small areas, researchers can use GPS collars to track many animals, over large areas and long time spans. These large datasets have the potential to provide rich information about animal behavior. However, this tracking data needs to be integrated with geospatial data about the environment in order to put the movements and estimated behaviors into context. We present an immersive visualization which integrates high resolution topological data from Barro Colorado Island, a 4000 acre island located in the Panama Canal, with GPS tracking data from close to two dozen primates captured over several months. Our application leverages parallelization for rapid filtering of the movement data, allowing researchers to explore the data in a large-scale, immersive environment (CAVE2). We present this work in order to explore the possibility of creating virtual field environments from data, to bring the field into the lab and enable big data animal behavior research.",

We investigate our hypotheses by conducting a controlled user experiment. In the experiment we focus on the 3D city visualization technique used for software comprehension tasks. We deploy 3D city visualizations across a standard computer screen (SCS), an immersive 3D environment (I3D), and a physical 3D printed model (P3D). We asked twenty-seven participants (whom we divided in three groups for each medium) to visualize software systems of various sizes, solve a set of uniform comprehension tasks, and complete a questionnaire. We measured the effectiveness of visualizations in terms of performance, recollection, and user experience. We found that even though developers using P3D required the least time to identify outliers, they perceived the least difficulty when visualizing systems based on SCS.

        "abstract" : "Direct projection of 3D branching structures, such as networks of cables, blood vessels, or neurons onto a 2D image creates the illusion of intersecting structural parts and creates challenges for understanding and communication. We present a method for visualizing such structures, and demonstrate its utility in visualizing the abdominal aorta and its branches, whose tomographic images might be obtained by computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography, in a single 2D stylistic image, without overlaps among branches. The visualization method, termed uncluttered single-image visualization (USIV), involves optimization of geometry. This paper proposes a novel optimization technique that utilizes an interesting connection of the optimization problem regarding USIV to the protein structure prediction problem. Adopting the integer linear programming-based formulation for the protein structure prediction problem, we tested the proposed technique using 30 visualizations produced from five patient scans with representative anatomical variants in the abdominal aortic vessel tree. The novel technique can exploit commodity-level parallelism, enabling use of general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) technology that yields a significant speedup. Comparison of the results with the other optimization technique previously reported elsewhere suggests that, in most aspects, the quality of the visualization is comparable to that of the previous one, with a significant gain in the computation time of the algorithm.",

        "abstract" : "Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging modality that enables the in-vivo reconstruction and visualization of fibrous structures. To inspect the local and individual diffusion tensors, glyph-based visualizations are commonly used since they are able to effectively convey full aspects of the diffusion tensor. For several applications it is necessary to compare tensor fields, e.g., to study the effects of acquisition parameters, or to investigate the influence of pathologies on white matter structures. This comparison is commonly done by extracting scalar information out of the tensor fields and then comparing these scalar fields, which leads to a loss of information. If the glyph representation is kept, simple juxtaposition or superposition can be used. However, neither facilitates the identification and interpretation of the differences between the tensor fields. Inspired by the checkerboard style visualization and the superquadric tensor glyph, we design a new glyph to locally visualize differences between two diffusion tensors by combining juxtaposition and explicit encoding. Because tensor scale, anisotropy type, and orientation are related to anatomical information relevant for DTI applications, we focus on visualizing tensor differences in these three aspects. As demonstrated in a user study, our new glyph design allows users to efficiently and effectively identify the tensor differences. We also apply our new glyphs to investigate the differences between DTI datasets of the human brain in two different contexts using different b-values, and to compare datasets from a healthy and HIV-infected subject.",

        "abstract" : "With today's technical possibilities, a stable visualization scenario can no longer be assumed as a matter of course, as underlying data and targeted display setup are much more in flux than in traditional scenarios. Incremental visualization approaches are a means to address this challenge, as they permit the user to interact with, steer, and change the visualization at intermediate time points and not just after it has been completed. In this paper, we put forward a model for incremental visualizations that is based on the established Data State Reference Model, but extends it in ways to also represent partitioned data and visualization operators to facilitate intermediate visualization updates. In combination, partitioned data and operators can be used independently and in combination to strike tailored compromises between output quality, shown data quantity, and responsiveness-i.e., frame rates. We showcase the new expressive power of this model by discussing the opportunities and challenges of incremental visualization in general and its usage in a real world scenario in particular.",

Important temporal trends can be missed due to the lack of ability to find them with current visualization methods. In this paper, we propose a method to explore data at different temporal resolutions to discover and highlight data based upon time-varying trends. Using the wavelet transform along the time axis, we transform data points into multi-scale time series curve sets. The time curves are clustered so that data of similar activity are grouped together, at different temporal resolutions. The data are displayed to the user in a global time view spreadsheet where she is able to select temporal clusters of data points, and filter and brush data across temporal scales. With our method, a user can interact with data based on time activities and create expressive visualizations.",

        "abstract" : "Analysis of multivariate data is of great importance in many scientific disciplines. However, visualization of 3D spatially-fixed multivariate volumetric data is a very challenging task. In this paper we present a method that allows simultaneous real-time visualization of multivariate data. We redistribute the opacity within a voxel to improve the readability of the color defined by a regular transfer function, and to maintain the see-through capabilities of volume rendering. We use predictable procedural noise - random-phase Gabor noise - to generate a high-frequency redistribution pattern and construct an opacity mapping function, which allows to partition the available space among the displayed data attributes. This mapping function is appropriately filtered to avoid aliasing, while maintaining transparent regions. We show the usefulness of our approach on various data sets and with different example applications. Furthermore, we evaluate our method by comparing it to other visualization techniques in a controlled user study. Overall, the results of our study indicate that users are much more accurate in determining exact data values with our novel 3D volume visualization method. Significantly lower error rates for reading data values and high subjective ranking of our method imply that it has a high chance of being adopted for the purpose of visualization of multivariate 3D data.",

We propose cpmViz, a web-based tool that allows for interactive data exploration of the sensor readings in both of the spatial and temporal dimensions. The tool consists out of three views that are connected via linking and scrolling. We visualize static sensor uncertainty by introducing Voronoi cells to illustrate how much space is covered by an individual measurement unit. For mobile sensors, we showcase their activity periods and introduce the concept of sensor streaks as periods of uninterrupted recordings as a temporal uncertainty measure. As for spatial uncertainty, we color individual districts based on the amount of data that was recorded inside the user's selected time window. Using our system, we were able to easily spot major events like the city's initial earthquake in the sensor readings. Certain southern districts are clearly visible as areas of concern that we consider in need of more static sensors. Furthermore, we were also able to identify static as well as moving contaminations.",

        "abstract" : "We present a technique that conveys the uncertainty in the secondary structure of proteins-an abstraction model based on atomic coordinates. While protein data inherently contains uncertainty due to the acquisition method or the simulation algorithm, we argue that it is also worth investigating uncertainty induced by analysis algorithms that precede visualization. Our technique helps researchers investigate differences between multiple secondary structure assignment methods. We modify established algorithms for fuzzy classification and introduce a discrepancy-based approach to project an ensemble of sequences to a single importance-weighted sequence. In 2D, we depict the aggregated secondary structure assignments based on the per-residue deviation in a collapsible sequence diagram. In 3D, we extend the ribbon diagram using visual variables such as transparency, wave form, frequency, or amplitude to facilitate qualitative analysis of uncertainty. We evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of our technique through expert reviews using two example applications: the combined assignment against established algorithms and time-dependent structural changes originating from simulated protein dynamics.",

        "abstract" : "We propose the concept of teaching (and learning) unfamiliar visualizations by analogy, that is, demonstrating an unfamiliar visualization method by linking it to another more familiar one, where the in-betweens are designed to bridge the gap of these two visualizations and explain the difference in a gradual manner. As opposed to a textual description, our morphing explains an unfamiliar visualization through purely visual means. We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples: data table and parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and hyperbox, linear chart and spiral chart, and hierarchical pie chart and treemap. The analogy is commutative i.e. any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A series of studies showed that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. The participants could understand the unfamiliar visualization methods in all of the four pairs either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with the transitions from the familiar counterpart. The four examples suggest how helpful visualization pairings be identified and they will hopefully inspire other visualization morphings and associated transition strategies to be identified.",

Our three-stage framework, leads the learner through a series of tasks, each designed to develop different skills necessary for coming up with creative, innovative, effective, and purposeful visualizations. For that, we get the learners to create an explanatory visualization of an algorithm of their choice. By making an algorithm choice, and by following an active-learning and project-based strategy, the learners take ownership of a particular visualization challenge.

An open challenge is how to seamlessly link the physical with the digital -- how to continue taking advantage of the important affordances of paper, without missing out on digital functionality. This paper presents the authors' experience with developing systems for Human-Document Interaction based on augmented document interfaces and examines new challenges and opportunities arising for the document image analysis field in this area. The system presented combines state of the art camera-based document image analysis techniques with a range of complementary technologies to offer fluid Human-Document Interaction. Both fixed and nomadic setups are discussed that have gone through user testing in real-life environments, and use cases are presented that span the spectrum from business to educational applications.",

        "abstract" : "The analysis of sets of degraded documents, like historical ones, is error-prone and requires human help to achieve acceptable quality levels. However, human interaction raises 3 main issues when processing important amounts of pages: none of the user or the system should wait for work, information provided by a human operator should not be restricted to local isolated corrections, but rather produce durable changes in the system, the ability to interact with a human operator should not increase the complexity of document models nor duplicate them between analysis and human interaction processes. To solve those issues, we propose an iterative approach, based on a special mechanism called visual memory, to reintegrate external information during page analysis. So as to demonstrate the interest for existing systems, we explain how we adapted a (rule-based) page analysis tool to enable, in this iterative approach, a delayed interaction with a human operator based on an adaptation of error recovery principles for compilers and the well-known exception handling mechanism. We validated our iterative approach on sales registers from the 18th century.",

By using only 2D deformation models, most existing methods give non-realistic synthetic document images. Thus, we propose to use 3D approach for reproducing geometric distortions in real documents. First, a new proposed texture coordinate generation technique extracts texture coordinates of each vertex in the document shape (mesh) resulting from 3D scanning of a real degraded document. Then, any 2D document image can be overlayed on the mesh by using an existing texture image mapping method. As a result, many complex real geometric distortions can be integrated in generated synthetic images. These images then can be used for enriching training sets or for performance evaluation. The degradation method here is jointly used with the character degradation model we proposed in [1] to generate the 6000 semi-synthetic degraded images of the music score removal staff line competition of ICDAR 2013.",

Yet for automatic processing this task has proven elusive, especially in the case of handwritten documents with complex layouts, which is why semiautomatic methods that integrate the human user into the process are needed. In this paper, we introduce a user-centered segmentation method based on document graphs and scribbling interaction. The graphs capture a sparse representation of the document's structure that can then be edited by the user with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen. We evaluate the proposed method on a newly introduced database of historical manuscripts with complex layout and demonstrate, first, that the document graphs are already close to the desired segmentation and, second, that scribbling allows a natural and efficient interaction.",

        "title" : "Intelligent document understanding: Understanding photographs with captions",
        "abstract" : "The interaction of textual and photographic information in document understanding is explored. Specifically, a computational model whereby textual captions are used as collateral information in the interpretation of the corresponding photographs is presented. The final understanding of the picture and caption reflects a consolidation of the information obtained from each of the two sources and can thus be used in intelligent information retrieval tasks. The problem of performing general-purpose vision without apriori knowledge is very difficult at best. The concept of using collateral information in scene understanding has been explored in systems that use general scene context in the task of object identification. The work described extends this notion by incorporating picture specific information. Finally, as a test of the model, a multi-stage system PICTION which uses captions to identify humans in an accompanying photograph is described. This provides a computationally less expensive alternative to traditional methods of face recognition since it does not require a pre-stored database of face models for all people to be identified.",

        "abstract" : "Automatic script identification from handwritten document images facilitates many important applications such as indexing, sorting and triage. A given Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system is typically trained on only a single script but for documents or collections containing different scripts, there must be some way to automatically identify the script prior to OCR. For Indic script research, some results have been reported in the literature but the task is far from solved. In this paper, we propose a word-level script identification technique for six handwritten Indic scripts- Bangla, Devanagari, Gurumukhi, Malayalam, Oriya Telugu and the Roman script. A set of 82 features has been designed using a combination of elliptical and polygonal approximation techniques. Our approach has been evaluated on a dataset of 7000 handwritten text words, using multiple classifiers. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier was found to be the best classifier resulting in 95.35% accuracy. The result is progressive considering the complexities and shape variations of the Indic scripts.",

Within the ERASMUS PLUS HiCure project, which aims to develop an integrated health informatics curricula, this work was conducted to identify the necessary topics and needed skills. To achieve, a literature analysis was conducted to gain a comprehensive insight of existing health informatics curricula and recommendations of both scientific community and professional bodies. This analysis resulted in identifying some key competencies, that students should learn within a health informatics education, to gain the critical skills needed for specifying, evaluating and developing health information systems as well as performing health information management.",

The results indicated that there is a direct significant relation between e-Health technology design and intention to use m-Health informatics. The results also confirmed that intention to use m-Health informatics is influenced by the perceptions of the user of e-Health technology in terms of the design approach, especially in relation to the navigation and the data presentation.

It is expected that recent advances in big data will expand our knowledge for testing new hypotheses about disease management from diagnosis to prevention to personalized treatment. The rise of big data, however, also raises challenges in terms of privacy, security, data ownership, data stewardship, and governance. This paper discusses some of the existing activities and future opportunities related to big data for health, outlining some of the key underlying issues that need to be tackled.",

        "abstract" : "Health-related behaviors are among the most significant determinants of health and quality of life. Improving health behavior is an effective way to enhance health outcomes and mitigate the escalating challenges arising from an increasingly aging population and the proliferation of chronic diseases. Although it has been difficult to obtain lasting improvements in health behaviors on a wide scale, advances at the intersection of technology and behavioral science may provide the tools to address this challenge. In this paper, we describe a vision and an approach to improve health behavior interventions using the tools of behavioral informatics, an emerging transdisciplinary research domain based on system-theoretic principles in combination with behavioral science and information technology. The field of behavioral informatics has the potential to optimize interventions through monitoring, assessing, and modeling behavior in support of providing tailored and timely interventions. We describe the components of a closed-loop system for health interventions. These components range from fine grain sensor characterizations to individual-based models of behavior change. We provide an example of a research health coaching platform that incorporates a closed-loop intervention based on these multiscale models. Using this early prototype, we illustrate how the optimized and personalized methodology and technology can support self-management and remote care. We note that despite the existing examples of research projects and our platform, significant future research is required to convert this vision to full-scale implementations.",

        "abstract" : "Detecting epidemic out breaks as early as possible and gathering reports to substantiate the cause and carrying out immediate actions for alerting public and taking action are major targets of a public health epidemic surveillance. Challenges for an epidemiologist lies in reaching out and collecting information from a territory especially in getting informal reports from public rather than gathering formal reports from clinical trial people like doctors and micro biologists. The smart phones and internet usage is reaching out common people rapidly due to the technological growth over past 15 years. Hence technology adaptation using mobile apps would not be a major constraint in reaching out people for conducting surveillance. Our proposed methodology suggested for public health surveillance programme part of public health informatics is a smart phone based surveillance system where epidemiologist can trigger survey queries through web portal and notify them to all the intended community through mobile app of registered smart phone users. The information retrieved back as reply for the queries can be easily stored in centralized real time database and can be analyzed by using machine Learning techniques. Prediction messages, alert messages and precautionary messages are send to targeted group of community under epidemic surveillance as common message as well as individual messages specifically addressing an individual who had participated in the survey. Real time databases are ideal foil to the mobile health based epidemic surveillance system. The pilot testing of the proposed prototype provided the instant benefit of immediate reachability of survey to selected and intended group. Mobile app based surveillance provided much improved reporting of information in quick time on diseases, symptoms, factors and more. Information gathered was analyzed for substantiating cause and alert and preventive messages were immediately send through the same app.",

        "abstract" : "In recent years, the introduction of data analytics to large amounts of healthcare data collected on daily basis opened numerous new opportunities and challenges in the field of medical informatics. By definition, healthcare informatics refers to the process of leveraging information technologies to improve the quality of healthcare. Many researchers are focusing on basic and translational research to achieve this goal by proposing novel or applying and adapting the state-of-the-art data analytics techniques to vast amounts of recently collected data. Recent adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) opens additional opportunities for data analytics, as we are able to access structured and unstructured data that is systematically collected for each event in the healthcare system or even contributed by the patients themselves. This tutorial covers different data analytics techniques and their translational value in improving the quality of healthcare. In the introductory part of the tutorial, we will outline the basics of data analytics in healthcare and continue with description of data representation that is specific to this field. The second part of the tutorial will present concrete state-of-the-art approaches that can be applied in healthcare informatics. Participants will gain a better understanding of risk estimation and stratification, patient similarity, privacy-preserving predictive modelling and patient-based classification. All methods presented in the tutorial have great translational value and can be implemented as a stand-alone solution or a part of health information systems. The intended audience of this tutorial are healthcare professionals and researchers from all fields of healthcare informatics. No specific knowledge will be required since the tutorial is self-contained and most fundamental concepts will be introduced during the presentation.",

One of the best approaches to improve software processes is to adopt a Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiative, which evaluates current practices and the way software products and services are developed. However, the rapid increase of data, an inappropriate knowledge management, a misunderstanding about information and knowledge, among other current issues and challenges, have complicated these SPI initiatives. From a data perspective, a recent study identifies the required elements to be adopted in SPI to succeed and suggests the creation of a data analysis model for SPI.

The quality of the developed software is straightforwardly dependent on the quality of the development process, researchers and practitioners primarily focus on improvement of the software process. Software Process Improvement (SPI) is a systematic and well-organized approach for development of the capabilities of software organizations and it is done through the evaluation of the existing practices of the organization and development of the software processes based on the competencies and experiences of the practitioners of the organization. There are a number of studies that focus on the practical use of KM in SPI. In this research work it has been explored though multicase analysis how KM can be significant and supports SPI.",

        "abstract" : "In recent years, data science emerged as a new and important discipline. It can be viewed as an amalgamation of classical disciplines like statistics, data mining, databases, and distributed systems. Existing approaches need to be combined to turn abundantly available data into value for individuals, organizations, and society. Moreover, new challenges have emerged, not just in terms of size (“Big Data”) but also in terms of the questions to be answered. This book focuses on the analysis of behavior based on event data. Process mining techniques use event data to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, compare process variants, and suggest improvements. In later chapters, we will show that process mining provides powerful tools for today’s data scientist. However, before introducing the main topic of the book, we provide an overview of the data science discipline.",

        "abstract" : "Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot—even “sexy”—career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.",

        "abstract" : "According to revisions of survey law taking effect on January 1, 2003, the Korean geodetic datum has been changed from a local geodetic to a world geodetic system. Since the datum change demands a geographical data transformation, the National Geographic Information Institute has established step-by-step plans for the transformation of the land data constructed through the National GIS Project, and it is in progress. For maritime data, however, no detailed transformation plan has been established yet. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the maritime geographic data obtained through the Maritime GIS project and set up the data transformation scheme to a world geodetic system. In this study, the datum transformation parameters especially for the maritime geographical data are determined. From database constructed through MGIS, a total of 492 coordinate pairs were used in parameter determination initially. At this stage, three popular seven parameter transformation models, Bursa-Wolf, Molodensky and Veis model, and the multi regression equation are applied, and the transformation parameters from the Molodensky model are selected for its accuracy and consistency with the land data transformation method. To eliminate the local bias caused by the nonequally distributed stations, a network optimization is applied and 42 stations are selected to determine the final transformation parameters. The distortion after applying the similarity transformation is modeled through a least squares collocation with Gaussian model, and high accuracy better than 15 cm in coordinate transformation is obtained.",

The effect of different floating datum corrections was studied using theoretical model experiments, resulting in the conclusion that the velocity obtained after the floating datum correction with the minimum static correction errors depends on the velocity of the layer below the low velocity layer (LVL) lower boundary and is not related to topographic relief and LVL structure. For the real data processing case, wave equation numerical model experiments were conducted which resulted in a new method for calculating objective functions based on the waveform and modifications to the calculation equation for minimum static correction errors to make the method suitable for real data static correction processing using inhomogeneous velocity models with lower velocity boundary relief. Real data processing results demonstrate the method’s superiority.",

        "abstract" : "A semi-dynamic geodetic datum, composed of a static geodetic datum and a surface deformation model, is proposed in this study to maintain the accuracy of geodetic datum in Taiwan. A concept to construct the surface deformation model is also suggested to accommodate the characteristics of temporal variation of the velocity field and coseismic displacements caused by earthquakes in Taiwan. In this study, we proposed a surface deformation model, containing a secular velocity grid model during 2000–2016 and a coseismic displacement grid model of the 2016 ML 6.6 Meinong earthquake, as an example to examine its adaptability in Taiwan. The secular velocity field relative to the station KMNM from 2000 to 2016 was first evaluated in this study using data from 380 continuous GNSS stations in Taiwan. Integrating 672 campaign-mode GNSS velocities from 2002 to 2016, a secular velocity grid model was constructed using the Kriging interpolation method. The high-precision coseismic displacements of the 2016 Meinong earthquake calculated using the IGS ultra-rapid orbit were also evidenced. The coseismic displacement grid model for all Taiwan for this event was built using the kinematic dislocation model to prevent contamination from nontectonic sources. Another 1341 independent GNSS control points surveyed in 2013 and 2016 were adopted to validate the reliability of the surface deformation model. After correction by the deformation model, 1219 points (91%) matched the criterion at the urban region of cadastral surveying in Taiwan (< 6 cm). The Electronic Global Navigation Satellite System (e-GNSS) in Taiwan is suggested to be integrated with the geodetic semi-dynamic datum to improve the precision of e-GNSS and to monitor the accuracy of the surface deformation model in the Taiwan semi-dynamic datum.",

        "abstract" : "This paper describes a robust diagnosis method for a rotor system with a journal bearing. To enhance the robustness of a journal bearing diagnosis system, it is of great importance to define an optimum datum unit for featuring anomaly states of the rotor system. To support the research goal, this study makes use of three measures for class separation, including Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR), and a newly proposed measure: probability of separation (PoS). From the viewpoint of class separability, this work found that PoS is more attractive than other methods for quantification of class separation. PoS offers favorable properties like normalization, boundedness, and high sensitivity. A generic algorithm integrated with one of three measures consistently suggested the optimum datum units among the feasible datum units. Optimum datum units were found to be one-cycle for time-domain features and sixty-cycles for frequency-domain features. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the optimum datum units was used for diagnosing a normal and three anomaly states. The health classification results showed that the proposed optimum datum units can outperform other datum units.",

        "abstract" : "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in many critical applications, including Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) applications, automated financial trading applications, autonomous vehicles, and intrusion detection systems for the decision-making process of users or automated systems. However, malicious adversaries have strong interests in manipulation the operations of machine learning algorithms to achieve their objectives in gaining financially, injecting injury or disasters. Adversaries against ML can be classified based on their capabilities and goals into two types: Adversary who has full knowledge of the ML models and parameters (white-box scenario) and one that does not have any knowledge and use guessing techniques to figure out the ML model and its parameters (black-box scenario). In both scenarios, the adversaries will attempt to maliciously manipulate model either during training or testing. Defending against these attacks can be successful by following three methods: 1) making the ML model robust to adversary, 2) validating and verifying input, or 3) changing ML architecture. In this paper, we present a resilient machine learning (rML) ensemble against adversarial attacks by dynamically changing the ML architecture and the ML models to be used such that the adversaries have no knowledge about the current ML model being used and consequently stop their attempt to manipulate the ML operations at testing phase. We evaluate the effectiveness of our rML ensemble using the benchmarking, zero-query dataset “DAmageNet” that contains both clean and adversarial image samples. We use three main neural networks in our ensemble that includes VGG16, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. The experimental results show that our rML can tolerate the adversarial samples and achieve high classification accuracy with small execution time degradation.",

        "abstract" : "In this short editorial we present some thoughts on present and future trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) generally, and Machine Learning (ML) specifically. Due to the huge ongoing success in machine learning, particularly in statistical learning from big data, there is rising interest of academia, industry and the public in this field. Industry is investing heavily in AI, and spin-offs and start-ups are emerging on an unprecedented rate. The European Union is allocating a lot of additional funding into AI research grants, and various institutions are calling for a joint European AI research institute. Even universities are taking AI/ML into their curricula and strategic plans. Finally, even the people on the street talk about it, and if grandma knows what her grandson is doing in his new start-up, then the time is ripe: We are reaching a new AI spring. However, as fantastic current approaches seem to be, there are still huge problems to be solved: the best performing models lack transparency, hence are considered to be black boxes. The general and worldwide trends in privacy, data protection, safety and security make such black box solutions difficult to use in practice. Specifically in Europe, where the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May, 28, 2018 which affects everybody (right of explanation). Consequently, a previous niche field for many years, explainable AI, explodes in importance. For the future, we envision a fruitful marriage between classic logical approaches (ontologies) with statistical approaches which may lead to context-adaptive systems (stochastic ontologies) that might work similar as the human brain.",

        "abstract" : "Machine learning, being an important part of artificial intelligence, is increasingly discussed and rated in the media without explaining its functionality. This can lead to misconceptions of its real impact and range of application, a problem especially concerning young people. This contribution focuses on the theory-driven development and practical experience with an unplugged workshop concept, which is about a simple technique of machine learning, as a basis for possible teaching units for high school students. For this purpose, the focus of the workshop is an action-oriented method to simulate the classification of screws with two different lengths. Workshop participants can reconstruct linear classification by moving a classifier represented by a wooden strip according to defined rules after each insertion of training data on a pinboard. The aim is to examine whether and how the topic can be made understandable at school. Pre- and posttests are used to evaluate the impact of the workshop on the participants’ image of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The results of this research suggest that it is possible to reduce simple methods of machine learning for teaching this topic at school. Moreover, it seems that even a 90-min workshop can change the participants’ conceptions of machine learning and artificial intelligence to a more realistic appreciation of their impact.",

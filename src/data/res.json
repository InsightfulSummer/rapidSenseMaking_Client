The proposed method employs a two-level strategy to select terms from WordNet. First, it fetches synsets of the initial query terms. Then, it extracts synsets of these synsets. In order to score the expansion terms on Wikipedia, we proposed a new weighting score named as an in-link score. We employed a tf-idf-based scoring system to assign a score to expansion terms extracted from WordNet. After assigning a score to individual query terms, we further re-weighted the selected expansion terms using the correlation score with respect to the entire query. The combination of the two data sources works well for extracting relevant expansion terms, and the proposed QE technique performs well with these terms on several weighting models. It also yields better results when compared to the two methods individually and with the other related state-of-the-art methods.
